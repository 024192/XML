Here are three XPath expressions you can use to extract information from the XML document:

1. Select all post authors:
/microblogsite/post/author


2. Select posts by a specific author (e.g., JohnDoe):
/microblogsite/post[author='JohnDoe']


3. Select posts published after a certain date (e.g., after 2022-01-01):
/microblogsite/post[timestamp > '2022-01-01']

# XML Example: Microblog Posts

This repository contains an example of XML data representing a microblog with users, posts, and comments.

## XML Structure (microblog.xml)

The `microblog.xml` file consists of two main sections: users and posts. Each user has an ID, username, and email. Each post includes an ID, user ID (indicating the author), title, content, and optional comments. Here's a simplified overview of the XML structure:


## XSLT Transformation (microblog.xslt)

The `microblog.xslt` file contains XSLT instructions to transform the XML data into an HTML representation suitable for displaying microblog posts. Each post is formatted with its title, content, author, and comments (if any).

## XPath Expression (xpath.txt)

The `xpath.txt` file contains an XPath expression to select all post titles from the XML document. This expression can be used programmatically or in XPath processors to retrieve specific information from the XML data.

## Microblog Rendering (Microblog.html)

The `Microblog.html` file contains the end product of the `microblog.xml` file.

## Usage

To apply the XSLT transformation, use any XSLT processor or tool and provide `microblog.xslt` as the stylesheet and `microblog.xml` as the input XML file. This will generate an HTML representation of the microblog posts.

The XPath expression in `xpath.txt` can be used to programmatically extract post titles from the XML document.
